## Install required packages

To install the required packages for this project. Please run the following command,

```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

## How to run the code

After installed the requirements file, run the command as below.
If your platform is Linux/MacOS

```
python3 HMM.py
```

Or in Windows.

```
python HMM.py
```

Although there is no problem when running `HMM.py`, I do recommend to run this file through the Python notebook as `./ipynb/HMM.ipynb`.
Please install the jupyter notebook by the following instructions.
If your platform is Linux/MacOS.

```
pip3 install jupyter
```

Or in Windows.

```
pip install jupyter
```

After `jupyter` is installed, start the jupyter notebook by the command.

```
jupyter notebook
```

The notebook will start on your browser and navigate to this project directory and click the `nerualnets.ipynb` under the `./ipynb`. For more information of jupyter notebook. Please refer to this [link](https://jupyter-notebook-beginner-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/what_is_jupyter.html). If you don't want to use jupyter notebook, please use the IDE like `VScode` to open the notebook file.
