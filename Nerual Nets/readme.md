## Environment

This script has been tested on python 3.7.3, please at least python >= 3.6 to make sure the script run properly. Also, please install the required packages in the `requirements.txt` by run the following command.

## How to run the code

After installed the requirements file, run the command as below.
If your platform is Linux/MacOS

```
python3 NeuralNet.py
```

Or in Windows.

```
python NeuralNet.py
```

The graph and table results will be propagated under the same folder as `NeuralNet.py`, and terimal will display the statistics analysis.

Although there is no problem when running `NeuralNet.py`, I do recommend to run this file through the Python notebook as `nerualnets.ipynb`.
Please install the jupyter notebook by the following instructions.
If your platform is Linux/MacOS.

```
pip3 install jupyter
```

Or in Windows.

```
pip install jupyter
```

After `jupyter` is installed, start the jupyter notebook by the command.

```
jupyter notebook
```

The notebook will start on your browser and navigate to this project directory and click the `nerualnets.ipynb` under the `./ipynb`. For more information of jupyter notebook. Please refer to this [link](https://jupyter-notebook-beginner-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/what_is_jupyter.html). If you don't want to use jupyter notebook, please use the IDE like `VScode` to open the notebook file.

## Results

The `Results.pdf` contain all the visuals and comments for this project. All the visuals used in the pdf file are in `./graph` folder.
